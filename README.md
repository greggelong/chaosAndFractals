some exercises from David P. Feldman's book
## Chapter 1
- functions as actions (eg. triple the input)
- function as formula (eg f(x) = 3x
- functions as graphs (test with the vertical line test, each input will always produce the same output)
- From the above it follows that functions are deterministic.
