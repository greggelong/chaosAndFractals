# chaosAndFractals
some exercises from David P. Feldman's book
## Chapter 1
- functions as actions (eg. triple the input)
- function as formula (eg f(x) = 3x
- functions as graphs (test with the vertical line test, each input will always produce the same output)
- From the above it follows that functions are deterministic.

## Chapter 4 5  6 and 22

4 5 6 and 22 have to do with iterating functions

4 time series plots

5 graphic iteration and cobweb plots 

see https://github.com/greggelong/functionPlot

6 iterating linear functions

chapter 22 is julia sets so numbers that remain bounded and dont go to infinity

for example a linear function that has a fixed point and the slope of the function is less than 1 and greater than -1 

so no points go toward infinity so the julia set is the whole number line.  you can see this

with cobweb plots
